# MSU Thesis Class Version 3.5b 2022/08/19

Copyright 2011-2022 by Alan Munn <amunn@msu.edu>

This is a class file for producing dissertations and theses according to
the Michigan State University Graduate School Guidelines for Electronic
Submission of Master's Theses and Dissertations (March 2020).

The class is based on the `memoir` document class, and therefore inherits
all of the functionality of that class.
